Contributing to JSON Cut
########################

Welcome!  Your contributions are valued; bug reports, code contributions, 
documentation improvements, helping answer posted questions, etc.

Open Source should be fun; be courteous, be respectful and enjoy.  This
project adheres to the following `Code of Conduct <http://bit.ly/2pM2TX4>`_.

New Contributor to Open Source?
===============================

If you've never contributed to Open Source before some projects can be a
little bit scary; have no fear, this project is gentle, it doesn't bite.
JSON Transformation micro-packages are intentionally simple; i.e.
`Occam's Razor <http://bit.ly/2qJ8AsT>`_, and are a great place to start.

As with most any Open Source project contributions will be reviewed and it's
important to understand that it's normal to receive constructive feedback,
to have submissions kicked back for rework, and have new features or ideas
rejected if the project maintainer believes they're outside the project
scope. If this happens to you, please don't take it personally; with the
right attitude contributing to Open Source can be rewarding, a great
way to learn, and a lot fun.
